## Instructions

Updating the README.md file to include non-default text.

This is a website that is built dynamically. The nav bar at the top requires each section to contain the `data-nav` tag with a section title. (IE `Section 1`, `Section 2`, or `Section3`).

The navigation links will generate a smooth scrolling animation to scroll to the correct section per the `data-nav` tag.

The `your-active-tag` should updated depending on where the user is scrolling on the page.
